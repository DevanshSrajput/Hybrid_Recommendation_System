## About

Welcome to the **Hybrid Recommendation System**!  
This project is a not-so-humble attempt to combine the best of collaborative and content-based filtering, because why settle for one when you can have both (and twice the bugs)?  
Built with Python, Streamlit, and a healthy dose of sarcasm.

---

## Model Details

- **Collaborative Filtering:**  
  Uses user-item interaction matrices to find users who are suspiciously similar to you (statistically, not emotionally).
  - Implemented with matrix factorization and nearest neighbors.
  - Handles cold start about as well as your average barista handles a complicated coffee order.

- **Content-Based Filtering:**  
  Recommends movies based on their features (genres, tags, etc.), because sometimes you just want more of the same.
  - Uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity.
  - Ignores your actual taste, but hey, at least it‚Äôs explainable.

- **Hybrid Model:**  
  Combines both approaches, so you get the worst of both worlds (just kidding, it‚Äôs actually pretty good).
  - Weighted blending of collaborative and content-based scores.
  - Tunable weights, because you love tweaking knobs.

---

## Dataset Used

- **MovieLens** (100k, 1M, or 10M, depending on how much RAM you want to sacrifice)
  - [GroupLens MovieLens Datasets](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
  - Includes user ratings, movie metadata, and enough missing values to keep things interesting.

---

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Download and clean MovieLens data.
   - Encode user and item IDs (because models don‚Äôt like strings).
   - Engineer content features (genres, tags, etc.).
   - Split into train/test, because we‚Äôre not savages.

2. **Model Training:**  
   - Train collaborative filtering model on user-item matrix.
   - Train content-based model on movie features.
   - Combine both in a hybrid model, because synergy.

3. **Evaluation:**  
   - Precision, recall, F1, NDCG, RMSE, coverage, diversity, novelty, and other metrics you‚Äôll probably ignore.
   - Interactive analytics dashboard, so you can pretend to care about the numbers.

4. **Web Interface:**  
   - Built with Streamlit, because everyone loves sliders and buttons.
   - Real-time recommendations, analytics, and data exploration.
   - Sidebar navigation, because tabs are too mainstream.

## How to Run

1. **Clone this repo**  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DevanshSrajput/hybrid-recommendation-system.git
   cd hybrid-recommendation-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch the web interface**  
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
   Or, if you‚Äôre feeling old-school:
   ```
   streamlit run src/web_interface.py
   ```

4. **Profit**  
   (Just kidding, this is open source.)
